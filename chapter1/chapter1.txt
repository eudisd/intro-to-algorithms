Give a real-world example that requires sorting or a real-world example that re- quires computing a convex hull.
Sorting: A race, where racers with the smallest pre-race lap-times in front, and those with the bigger lap-times trending towards the back.

Other than speed, what other measures of efficiency might one use in a real-world setting?
Memory, programmer efficiency, algorithm complexity
1.1-3
Select a data structure that you have seen previously, and discuss its strengths and limitations.
Linked-List: It's strengths are that it's easily extendible.  Appending and inserting at end and beginning of list is efficient.  Disadvantage is that elements have to accessed sequentially.  Insertion is also sequential as well as deletions.

How are the shortest-path and traveling-salesman problems given above similar? How are they different?  The traveling-salesmen problem asks that the traveler visits each vertex or city exactly once, while the shortest path requires that only the traversal of those paths that lead to the shortest path, but not all.
1.1-5
Come up with a real-world problem in which only the best solution will do. Then come up with one in which a solution that is “approximately” the best is good enough.
